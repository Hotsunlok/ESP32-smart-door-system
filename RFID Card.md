# üÜî **Pre-Authorized ID Enrollment (RFID)**

Before using the **RC522 RFID Module**, you must **enroll a pre-authorized card**.  
This process ensures the system can **verify the correct card ID** for unlocking or locking the door.

---

## üìñ **How to Get the Pre-Authorized ID**
If you **haven't enrolled a card yet**, follow this guide to retrieve your **RFID card ID** from the **Serial Monitor**  
and copy the ID into the code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Enrollment is REQUIRED!**
üö® **WARNING: The system will NOT work unless you enroll a pre-authorized ID first!**  
Before testing, **ensure that your RFID card is successfully registered**.  

‚úÖ **If enrollment is not completed**, the system **CANNOT verify any card**, and access will be denied.  

‚ö†Ô∏è SO PLEASE WATCH THE ABOVE LINK to finish enrollment step first !!!
