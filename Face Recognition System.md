# Face Recognition System

## Introduction

- 😊 Face recognition is a technology used to identify or verify a person using their facial features.
- 📸 It captures an image, analyzes facial patterns, and compares them with stored data.
- 🔒 This system is commonly used in security, mobile devices, and smart access control.
- 🚪 Our system integrates face recognition with an ESP32 smart door lock to provide secure and automated access.

## Requirements

To run the face recognition system, the following technologies are required:

- 🐍 **Python**: Used for processing the face recognition logic.
- 🤖 **OpenCV**: A computer vision library that helps detect and recognize faces.
- 🔌 **Arduino C**: Used for programming the ESP32 microcontroller to control the door lock.

These three components work together to capture images, analyze faces, and send unlock signals to the smart door lock.
