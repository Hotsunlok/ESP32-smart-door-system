# üè† Real-World Testing: Smart Door System

After confirming all the methods and components are working fine, a **real-world use case** can be conducted by **combining different components** and **multiple methods** to unlock and lock the door.  
This ensures that the **Smart Door System** operates **smoothly** and that all components work together **effectively**.

### üîÑ **Testing Sequence**
To test the performance and **reliability** of the system, the following sequence is used:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Unlock using Keypad**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Lock using RFID Card**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Unlock using Fingerprint Sensor**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lock using Web Interface (Toggle Switch Button)**  

By **switching between different methods**, this test confirms that the **Smart Door System** can handle **seamless transitions** across all unlocking and locking methods.  
This ensures **smooth performance** and provides a **reliable** access control system.
